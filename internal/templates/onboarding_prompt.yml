  Welcome to the Protobuf MCP Server! I've created a configuration file for your project.

  Project directory: {{.ProjectRoot}}
  Configuration file: .protobuf-mcp.yml

  Next steps:
  1. Review the generated .protobuf-mcp.yml file and its help comments
  2. Explore your project's proto files to understand the structure
  3. Update the configuration file with appropriate protoFiles and importPaths
  4. Test the configuration by using list_services or get_schema tools

  The configuration file includes detailed comments to guide you through the setup process.
  You can modify the protoFiles and importPaths arrays based on your project structure.

  Once configured, you can use the following tools:
  - list_services: List all protobuf services
  - get_schema: Get detailed schema information
  - activate_project: Switch to a different project directory
